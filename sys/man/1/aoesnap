.SH DESCRIPTION
Aoesnap uses AoE to download a snapshot of a machine's state.
Snapshots are like Unix core dumps, but allow easy
debugging on foreign architectures.  The target
maybe be anywhere on the local Ethernet segment,
but it must understand how to serve AoE snapshots.
Currently, only the Coraid VS knows how to serve
AoE snapshots.
