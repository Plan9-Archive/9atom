.SH NAME
xb \- XML beautifier
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xb
[
.B dM
][
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xb
performs a DOM model, non-validating parse of the given XML
file (or standard input if none specified). This is then written
to standard output reformatted into an indented, one-line-per-element
style.
.PP
.I Xb
takes some liberties with the document which may effect later
interpretation, though it is idempotent:
.IP -
Re-formatting the will change the meaning of PCdata in the
XML file if leading and trailing whitespace is significant.
.IP -
All comments are stripped, though the 
.B DOCTYPE
structured comment is preserved. A new XML version
comment is always generated on the output.
.IP -
Attributes are always quoted with single quotes
whether the source uses single or double quotes.
.IP -
Empty long form elements are replaced with their short form;
for example:
.EX
	<fred a='1'>
	</fred>
.EE
 is replaced with
.EX
	<fred a='1' />
.EE
.IP -
.I Xml
has its own view of the valid characterset for XML files, which might
result in slightly different characters being escaped as entity references
to those on the input. This is only a matter of interpretation, the meaning
of the file will be unaffected.
