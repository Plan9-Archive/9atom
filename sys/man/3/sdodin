.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I sdodin
driver provides access to SAS, SATA and ATAPI devices via the
.IR sd (3)
interface.  The Odin programming interface supports up to 16
hot-swappable devices per controller.
.PP
Odin controllers are detected automatically.
Currently only the Marvell 6485 is supported, although
devices using the Marvell 6420, 6440 and 6480 chipsets can
likely be supported with minimal changes.
.PP
The top level control file,
.BR /dev/sdctl ,
supports the following control messages for
.IR sdodin :
.TF "\fLodin idprint"
.TP
.B odin debug
Toggle debug messages.  Default is off.
.TP
.B odin idprint
Toggle printing of drive identification messages.  Default is on.
Prints short messages when a drive is identified or removed.
.TP
.B odin aprint
Print SCSI commands executed.  Default is off.
.PD
.PP
The device-level
.B ctl
file supports:
.TF \fLnopower
.TP
.BI "state " state
Force a transition to the named
.IR state .
The states are:
.RS
.TF portreset
.TP
.B null
ignored (may only be reached manually);
.TP
.B missing
not detected;
.TP
.B nopower
detected in power-saving state;
.B new
newly discovered;
.TP
.B ready
ready for commands;
.TP
.B error
not ready for commands due to error;
.TP
.B reset
being reset gently;
.TP
.B portreset
being fully reset;
.TP
.B offline
device failed
.B portreset
(a port reset will be attempted periodically).

.PP
For devices present at boot, the transition is from state
.B new
to state
.BR ready .
.PP
The
.B led
file allows the external control of enclosure LED
states through SES-2 messages over GPIO/SFF-8485.  IÂ²C
transport is not supported.  The contents of the
.B led
file is the current state of the port's LEDs.  Writing
a state to the file will set the given state.
The Odin does not set LED states and slots without
drives may not be controlled.  The standard SES states accepted are
.TF \fLfailarray
.TP
.B none
no state set;
.TP
.B normal
nominal condition;
.TP
.B rebuild
parent lun is rebuilding;
.TP
.B locate
show drive location;
.TP
.B spare
hot spare drive;
.TP
.B pfa
predicted failure;
.TP
.B critarray
array has lost redundency;
.TP
.B failarray
failed array;
.TP
.B fail
drive has failed and should be replaced.
backplane buzzer will sound.
.PD
.PP
The LED state has no effect on drive function.

.SH BUGS
Enclosure management, port multipliers and SAS expanders
are not supported.  Commands that take too long to
complete will be timed out;
.L "security erase unit"
is almost certain to time out.
