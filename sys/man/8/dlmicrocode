.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dlmicrocode
uses standard SCSI or ATA commands to update
a drive's microcode with a new firmware blob specified
with the
.B -f
flag.  Firmware is drive and model specific, and there
is no guarantee that a drive will implement sufficient
checking.  Be careful!

.EX
	disk/dlmicrocode -f fw /dev/sdE0 /dev/sdE1

.SH BUGS
Bricks are possible.  Data loss is possible.  Firmware update is often not
implemented robustly, and even if they work, your data may be gone.
