.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs assist in dealing with on-board flash.
.I Flashpart
uses the environment variable
.BI flash n part
to partition the flash device
.BI #F n\fR.\fP
The variable is formatted as a sequence of partitions
seperated by
.LR / .
Each partition is described by the space-seperated 3-tuple
of name, start offset and end offset.
.PP
The
.I flashprep
tool builds a stand-alone bootable flash with nvram,
.IR plan9.ini (8)
and
a kernel then emits a u-boot boot command for the image
and attempts to create the appropriate partitions in
.BI #F n\fR.\fP
For ease of management, each element is put in a
seperate flash erase unit.  The erase size is read from
.BI #F n
but may be overridden with
.BR -e .
The default configuration file is
.B /cfg/pxe/ ea
and may be changed with the
.B -i
flag.
The default kernel is
.B /arm/9plug
and may be changed with the
.B -k
flag.
