.SH SYNOPSIS
.B restartdns
[

]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Restartdns
automates restarting
.I dns
(see
.IR ndb (8))
safely and emailing a problem
report.  You must be the hostowner to run it.
Typically
.I restartdns
is run from a cron job.
With no arguments,
.I dns
is restarted if there are broken
.I dns
processes or processes in
“query lock wait” state.  In this
case a snapshot of all dns processes
is taken and saved to
.BI /n/other/ user /dnssnap/ host.pid.unixtime 
and notification email is sent.
The
.B -f
flag forces a restart.
.PP
The script itself contains configuration
information such as the list of legal
host and the recipients of notification
email.

In Athens, the typical solution is to run
.I restartdns
on the dns server, currently
.BR atlas ,
as the hostowner,
currently
.BR dennis .
