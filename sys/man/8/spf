.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Spf
parses SPF records for
.I domain
and validates them against any additional arguments.  If there are no
additional arguments, the internal representation of the SPF records
is printed.  Typically,
.I spf
is invoked by
.IR smtpd
(see
.IR smtp (8))
through the
.B /mail/lib/validatesender
script.  There are four possible results of an spf invocation:
success, no match, no record found and timeout.  Unsuccessful results
are indicated by exit codes beginning with
.BR fail ,
.BR none ,
and
.BR deferred ,
respectively.
.PP
The policy implented is that negatively biased results are the equivalent
to negative match.  Thus
.B ~all
is treated the same as
.BR -all .
The
.B -e
flag makes this policy even more draconian, escalating neutral results
to failure.  This is useful for sites like
.B gmail.com
which enumerate all allowed hosts but end with an inclusive
neutral result.  This flag is not recomended as a default for all sites.
.PP
Flags are as follows:
.TF netroot
.PD
.TP
.B -d
print DNS queries as performed
.TP
.B -e
escalate; treat
.B ?all
as
.BR -all .
The result
.B ~all
is always treated the same as
.BR -all .
.TP
.B -m
ignore macros
.TP
.BI -n " netroot"
use the IP stack rooted at
.BI netroot .
.TP
.B -p
print the internal representation of the SPF records.
This is the default if only one argument is given.
.TP
.B -r
trace
.B include
and
.B redirect
elements.
.TP
.B -v
print records resulting in postitive
or negative match or bias.

.SH BUGS
Exp records are ignored.
.PP
Inproperly placed
.B redirect
queries are not evaluated last.
.PP
.I Spf
uses higher dns query limits than allowed by
the RFC as the authors of the RFC use SPF
records that require twice the allowed number of
queries.
