Numbered headdings -v- Bullets

Comments should be flagged as such somehow (square brackets ?).

headers and footers are a pain.
word allows you to specify them with things like indents and paragraph styles,
the fields may be laid out in left, center and right just like troff but in the wrong
order - and there is no requirment that they do this. also they have some auto fields,
page number (which we have) but number of pages (which we don't), printed date (which we have)
but filename and document version which we don't. all a can of worms and not worth the
effort IMHO.

numbered lists are a pain too
word keeps multiple parallel numbered lists and can swap and change between them with inpunity.
we can detect whether its a numbered or bulleted list easily enough but we would have to do
the paragraph numbering ourselves rather than relying on .NH as we would need to be able to
reset the numbering (easy, .NH 0) but also preset (not possible).

BUGS:

Some Snell docs are not getting underlined titles on teh first page - why?
