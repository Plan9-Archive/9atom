1. aoe tries to sleep with il lock held.
static void
strategy(Aoedev *d, Srb *s)
{
	send(d->work, s);
	sleep(s, srbready, s);	/* recv? */
}
called from ilhangup()
likely problem is that fileinit() causes i/o.
f->open & FREMOV ?
this is a pretty subtile problem.  any i/o problem
can hangup all of il.  

2. time gets reset.
