This is a crossword playing program.
To run it, you need to cp *.font /lib/font/bit/times

The crossword format is reminiscent of the
old picfile format.  It consists of a header 
of lines of the form "X=foo", a blank line,
then the crossword puzzle, then the puzzle
filled in with the answers (rot13'ed).
Then the clues, one per line.
The header must contain a line "DIM=nr nc"
that specifies the number of rows and columns
in the puzzle.

For example
	hget http://world.std.com/~wij/puzzles/upnorth.puz >upnorth.puz
	acrosslite upnorth.puz > upnorth.xword
	xword upnorth.xword
